# Java Operators and expressions

## Arithmetic Operators

    These operators are used for performing basic mathematical operations.

    + (Addition): Adds two operands.
    - (Subtraction): Subtracts the second operand from the first.
    * (Multiplication): Multiplies two operands.
    / (Division): Divides the numerator by the denominator.
    % (Modulus): Returns the remainder from division.

## Unary Operators
    These operators require only one operand and perform various operations like incrementing, decrementing, negating, etc.

    + (Unary plus): Indicates a positive value (often optional).
    - (Unary minus): Negates an expression.
    ++ (Increment): Increases the value of the operand by 1.
    -- (Decrement): Decreases the value of the operand by 1.
    ! (Logical complement): Inverts the value of a boolean expression.

## Relational Operators
    These operators are used to compare two values. They return a boolean result.

    == (Equal to): Checks if two values are equal.
    != (Not equal to): Checks if two values are not equal.
    > (Greater than): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
    < (Less than): Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
    >= (Greater than or equal to): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
    <= (Less than or equal to): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

## Logical Operators
    These operators are used to combine multiple boolean expressions.

    && (Logical AND): Returns true if both operands are true.
    || (Logical OR): Returns true if either operand is true.
    ! (Logical NOT): Inverts the boolean value.

## Bitwise Operators
    These operators perform bit-level operations on integer types.

    & (Bitwise AND)
    | (Bitwise OR)
    ^ (Bitwise XOR)
    ~ (Bitwise NOT)
    << (Left shift)
    >> (Right shift)
    >>> (Unsigned right shift)

## Assignment Operators
    These operators are used to assign values to variables.

    = (Assignment): Assigns the right-hand operand to the left-hand operand.
    +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=, <<=, >>=, >>>= (Compound assignments): Performs the operation and assigns the result to the left operand.

## Ternary Operator

    The ternary operator is a shorthand for if-else statements. It takes three operands and is used to evaluate boolean expressions.

    ? : (Ternary): Returns one of two values depending on the condition.

## Instanceof Operator

    The instanceof operator is used to check if an object is an instance of a specific class or subclass
