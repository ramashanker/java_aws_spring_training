# Java Class and Object

## . Class
    A class in Java is a template or blueprint that defines the structure and 
    behavior (data members and methods) that the objects created from the class 
    will have. It is a way to group related variables (fields) and functions 
    (methods) together.

## Object
    An object is an instance of a class. When you create an object, 
    you are using the class blueprint to create something that has the 
    properties and behaviors defined by the class.
