         Relational Operators
            These operators are used to compare two values. They return a boolean result.

            == (Equal to): Checks if two values are equal.
            != (Not equal to): Checks if two values are not equal.
            > (Greater than): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
            < (Less than): Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
            >= (Greater than or equal to): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
            <= (Less than or equal to): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
